# LiveKit AI Agent Framework: Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the LiveKit AI Agent Framework, providing a structured approach to ensure the reliability, correctness, and robustness of the multi-agent system. The strategy addresses testing at multiple levels, from individual mode functionality to complex cross-mode interactions and end-to-end scenarios.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on validating the core functionality of individual LiveKit modes in isolation.

#### Test Scope per Mode

| Mode | Test Focus Areas |
|------|-----------------|
| **LiveKit Coordinator** | - Decision tree logic<br>- Mode selection algorithms<br>- Request classification<br>- Coordinator state management |
| **LiveKit Auth** | - JWT token generation<br>- VideoGrant permission configuration<br>- Token expiration handling<br>- Role-based permission validation |
| **LiveKit Room** | - Room creation/deletion logic<br>- Configuration parameter validation<br>- Webhook configuration<br>- Metadata handling |
| **LiveKit Participant** | - Participant connection management<br>- Permission validation<br>- Status tracking logic<br>- Participant data manipulation |
| **LiveKit Track** | - Track configuration validation<br>- Simulcast settings management<br>- Track publishing/subscribing logic<br>- Media source validation |
| **LiveKit Recording** | - Recording start/stop logic<br>- Storage path validation<br>- Format configuration<br>- Composite vs individual recording logic |
| **LiveKit Egress** | - RTMP configuration validation<br>- Output file validation<br>- Streaming target validation<br>- Layout template validation |

#### Unit Testing Approach

1. **Mocked Dependencies**: All external services and dependencies (including the LiveKit server) should be mocked to isolate the mode's logic.

2. **Configuration Testing**: Verify that each mode correctly interprets and validates configuration parameters from its TOML+Markdown file.

3. **Quality Gate Verification**: Test that quality gates are properly applied for each operation.

4. **Error Handling**: Verify proper error handling and reporting when invalid inputs or configurations are provided.

5. **State Management**: For stateful operations, verify that state transitions occur correctly.

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests verify the interactions between LiveKit modes, particularly focusing on the coordinator-specialist workflow and cross-specialist interactions.

#### Key Integration Test Scenarios

1. **Coordinator → Specialist Routing**
   - Verify that the coordinator correctly routes requests to the appropriate specialist mode
   - Test with various request types, edge cases, and ambiguous scenarios
   - Verify context passing between coordinator and specialists

2. **Auth → Room Flow**
   - Test the flow from authentication to room creation
   - Verify that room creation respects the permissions granted in the auth token

3. **Room → Participant Flow**
   - Test participant addition to rooms with various permission configurations
   - Verify participant state management across mode boundaries

4. **Participant → Track Flow**
   - Test track management operations tied to specific participants
   - Verify cross-mode state consistency

5. **Recording/Egress Integration**
   - Test recording and egress operations integrated with room and participant management
   - Verify webhook event handling across mode boundaries

#### Integration Testing Approach

1. **Partial Mocking**: Mock external LiveKit server API but allow real inter-mode communication.

2. **Sequence Validation**: Verify that operations across modes happen in the correct sequence.

3. **Configuration Consistency**: Test that configuration settings are consistently applied across mode boundaries.

4. **Error Propagation**: Verify that errors from one mode are properly propagated and handled by other modes.

### 3. End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests validate complete user scenarios, involving real or simulated interactions with the LiveKit server.

#### Key E2E Scenarios

1. **Video Conference Setup**
   - Create room
   - Generate participant tokens with different permissions
   - Connect participants
   - Publish/subscribe to audio/video tracks
   - Verify correct media routing

2. **Recording Workflow**
   - Set up room with participants
   - Start recording (composite and individual)
   - Verify recording files are created with correct format and content
   - Stop recording
   - Verify final output

3. **Streaming Workflow**
   - Configure room for streaming
   - Set up RTMP destination
   - Start streaming
   - Verify stream is received at destination
   - Stop streaming

4. **Dynamic Room Reconfiguration**
   - Create room with initial configuration
   - Modify room settings during active session
   - Verify changes are applied correctly
   - Verify participants are affected as expected

5. **Error Recovery Scenarios**
   - Test system recovery from simulated failures
   - Verify graceful degradation when partial system components fail

#### E2E Testing Approach

1. **LiveKit Test Server**: Use a controlled LiveKit test server environment.

2. **Simulated Clients**: Employ automated client simulators to act as participants.

3. **Media Validation**: Validate media quality and routing through automated media analysis.

4. **Long-running Tests**: Include extended session tests to verify stability over time.

5. **Load Testing**: Test with varying numbers of participants to verify scaling behavior.

## Testing Tools & Infrastructure

### Recommended Testing Frameworks

1. **Unit Testing**: 
   - Jest/Mocha for JavaScript/TypeScript implementations
   - pytest for Python implementations
   - Go's built-in testing framework for Go implementations

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - SuperTest for REST API testing
   - Custom test harnesses for mode interaction testing

3. **E2E Testing**:
   - Playwright/Puppeteer for browser-based testing
   - LiveKit's client SDKs with custom test wrappers
   - Docker containers for controlled test environments

### Mock Server

Develop a "LiveKit Mock Server" that simulates the LiveKit API responses without requiring a full LiveKit deployment:

1. **API Simulation**: Implement mock endpoints matching the LiveKit server API.
2. **Configurable Behaviors**: Allow tests to configure specific server behaviors.
3. **Failure Injection**: Support injection of specific failure scenarios.

### CI/CD Integration
