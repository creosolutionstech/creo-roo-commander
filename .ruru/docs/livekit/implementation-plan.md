# LiveKit AI Agent Framework - Phased Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation approach for the LiveKit AI Agent Framework. It provides a structured roadmap with clear priorities, dependencies, and milestones to guide the development process.

## Implementation Philosophy

The implementation strategy follows these core principles:

1. **Value-First Approach**: Prioritize features that deliver immediate value to users and establish the foundation for more complex capabilities.
2. **Dependency-Driven Sequencing**: Build components in an order that respects technical dependencies.
3. **Incremental Complexity**: Start with simpler components and progressively tackle more complex ones.
4. **Early Validation**: Create validation opportunities at each phase to gather feedback and make adjustments.
5. **Modular Development**: Enable parallel work streams where dependencies permit.

## Phase 0: Foundational Setup (Weeks 1-2)

## Parallel Work Opportunities

While the phases above represent the logical sequence of development, some components can be developed in parallel by separate teams:

1. **Documentation** can begin in parallel with Phase 1 and continue throughout development
2. **Testing framework** can be established starting in Phase 1
3. **Export utility** development can occur parallel to specialist modes
4. **Quality gates** can be implemented incrementally across all phases

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| LiveKit API changes | Implement version detection and compatibility layer |
| Complex cross-mode operations | Early prototyping of interaction patterns, comprehensive testing |
| Performance bottlenecks | Regular profiling, optimization sprints, clear performance requirements |

| Integration challenges | Detailed integration documentation, blueprints, partner testing |

## Success Metrics

- **Functional Completeness**: All planned specialists and operations implemented
- **Quality**: 95%+ test coverage, all quality gates operational
- **Performance**: Response times within defined SLAs for each operation type
- **Usability**: Positive feedback from integration partners, clear documentation
- **Maintenance**: Clear extension points, documented update procedures

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the LiveKit AI Agent Framework, balancing technical dependencies with user value delivery. The phased approach allows for incremental development, early validation, and adjustment as needed while ensuring the end result is a comprehensive, high-quality framework.
