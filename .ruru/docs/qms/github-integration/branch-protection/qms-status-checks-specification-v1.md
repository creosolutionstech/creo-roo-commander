## Implementation Requirements

### GitHub Actions Integration
- All status checks must be implemented as GitHub Actions workflows
- Workflows must support matrix builds for multi-language/multi-environment projects
- Results must be reported back to GitHub status API
- Detailed logs and artifacts must be preserved for audit purposes

### Notification and Escalation
- Failed status checks must trigger appropriate notifications
- Escalation procedures must be implemented for blocked PRs
- Dashboard integration required for monitoring and reporting

### Performance Requirements
- Status checks must complete within 15 minutes (95th percentile)
- Parallel execution must be utilized where possible
- Intelligent caching must be implemented to reduce execution time

### Error Handling and Reliability
- Transient failures must be handled with automatic retry logic
- Fallback procedures must be available for external service failures
- Manual override capabilities must be available for authorized personnel

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Status Check Metrics
- Success/failure rates per check type
- Execution time distribution
- False positive rates
- Developer impact metrics

### Quality Metrics
- Defect escape rate to production
- Time to resolution for blocked PRs
- Developer satisfaction with QMS processes
- Overall delivery velocity impact

## Emergency Procedures

### Bypass Authorization Levels
1. **Level 1** (DevOps Lead): Can bypass non-critical checks (documentation, formatting)
2. **Level 2** (Technical Architect): Can bypass technical checks with justification
3. **Level 3** (QMS Coordinator): Can bypass any check with risk assessment
4. **Level 4** (Emergency Response Team): Can bypass all checks with post-incident review

### Post-Bypass Requirements
- All bypasses must be logged with justification
- Technical debt items must be created for skipped validations
- Post-merge compliance validation must be scheduled
- Incident review must be conducted for emergency bypasses

## Conclusion

This comprehensive status check specification ensures that all QMS requirements are enforced through automated GitHub branch protection rules. The multi-layered approach provides defense in depth while maintaining development velocity through intelligent automation and appropriate bypass procedures.

Regular review and updates of this specification are required to maintain effectiveness and adapt to evolving project needs and industry standards.
