# QMS Emergency Bypass Procedures v1.0

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive emergency bypass procedures that enable rapid deployment of critical fixes while ensuring complete post-merge compliance tracking and remediation. These procedures support the 4-level bypass authorization system and provide detailed workflows for incident management integration, audit documentation, and systematic remediation of bypassed quality gates.

## Emergency Response Framework

### Incident Classification Matrix

| Severity | Definition | Response Time | Bypass Authorization | Post-Incident Actions |
|----------|------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **S1 - Critical** | Complete service outage, data loss, security breach | ≤ 15 minutes | Emergency (Commander) | Immediate review + Board notification |
| **S2 - High** | Major functionality impaired, significant user impact | ≤ 1 hour | Level 3 (QMS Coordinator) | 24-hour review + Executive summary |
| **S3 - Medium** | Minor functionality impaired, limited user impact | ≤ 4 hours | Level 2 (Architect) | 3-day review + Team notification |
| **S4 - Low** | Cosmetic issues, no user impact | ≤ 24 hours | Level 1 (Lead) | 5-day review + Technical debt tracking |
