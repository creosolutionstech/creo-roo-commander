**Implementation**:
```javascript
// File: src/utils/validation.js
/**
 * Validates email format
 * @param {string} email - Email to validate
 * @returns {boolean} - True if valid email format
 */
export function isValidEmail(email) {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return typeof email === 'string' && emailRegex.test(email);
}
```

```javascript
// File: tests/utils/validation.test.js
import { isValidEmail } from '../../src/utils/validation.js';

describe('isValidEmail', () => {
  test('should return true for valid email', () => {
    expect(isValidEmail('test@example.com')).toBe(true);
  });
  
  test('should return false for invalid email', () => {
    expect(isValidEmail('invalid-email')).toBe(false);
  });
  
  test('should handle edge cases', () => {
    expect(isValidEmail('')).toBe(false);
    expect(isValidEmail(null)).toBe(false);
    expect(isValidEmail(undefined)).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

**Checkpoint Questions**:
- [ ] Did your branch name follow conventions?

## Module 4: Quality Gates Deep Dive

### Understanding Quality Gates

Quality gates are automated checkpoints that ensure code meets specific standards before progressing through the review workflow.

#### Code Coverage Gate

**Threshold**: ≥ 80% line coverage
**Tools**: Jest, Istanbul, SonarQube

**Configuration Example**:
```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    }
  }
};
```

**Best Practices**:
```javascript
// Good: Test behavior, not implementation
test('should calculate user age correctly', () => {
  const birthDate = new Date('1990-01-01');
  const age = calculateAge(birthDate);
  expect(age).toBe(34); // Assuming current year is 2024
});

// Better: Test edge cases
test('should handle leap year birthdays', () => {
  const birthDate = new Date('1992-02-29');
  const age = calculateAge(birthDate);
  expect(age).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

#### Security Scanning Gate

**Tools**: Snyk, OWASP ZAP, GitHub Security Advisories

**Common Vulnerabilities Checked**:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Direct Object References
- Security Misconfiguration
- Vulnerable Dependencies

**Remediation Examples**:
```javascript
// ❌ Vulnerable to XSS
const displayUserName = (name) => {
  document.innerHTML = `<h1>Welcome ${name}</h1>`;
};

// ✅ Safe implementation
const displayUserName = (name) => {
  const element = document.createElement('h1');
  element.textContent = `Welcome ${name}`;
  document.body.appendChild(element);
};
```

#### Performance Testing Gate

**Metrics Monitored**:
- Response time (< 200ms for API calls)
- Memory usage (< 10% increase)
- Bundle size (< 5% increase)
- Database query efficiency

**Performance Testing Example**:
```javascript
// Performance test
test('API endpoint should respond within 200ms', async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const response = await fetch('/api/users');
  const endTime = Date.now();
  
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(200);
});
```

### Exercise 4.1: Quality Gate Scenarios ⚡

**Scenario 1**: Fix Code Coverage Failure
You've received a DoD failure due to insufficient test coverage (75% vs 80% required).

**Your Task**:
1. Identify uncovered code paths
2. Write appropriate tests

**Scenario 2**: Resolve Security Vulnerability
A high-severity security vulnerability has been detected in your dependency chain.

**Your Task**:
1. Analyze the security report
2. Update vulnerable dependencies
3. Verify the fix doesn't break functionality

## Module 5: Advanced Scenarios

### Handling Complex Review Situations

#### Scenario: Emergency Hotfix Process

**Situation**: Production outage requiring immediate fix

**QMS Process Adaptations**:
1. **Fast-track DoR**: Minimal documentation acceptable
2. **Senior Review Priority**: Assign to senior engineers immediately
3. **Selective Gate Bypass**: Skip non-critical quality gates
4. **Post-deployment Validation**: Complete full QMS review after deployment

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create emergency branch
git checkout -b emergency/production-fix

# Request expedited review
@qms-bot priority critical --reason="Production outage affecting 50% of users"

# Skip non-critical gates if approved
@qms-bot skip-gate performance --reason="Emergency fix approved by @tech-lead"
```

#### Scenario: Large Feature Integration

**Situation**: Major feature spanning multiple teams and repositories

**QMS Strategies**:
1. **Phased Integration**: Break into smaller, reviewable chunks
2. **Cross-team Reviews**: Ensure expertise from all affected teams
3. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing
4. **Rollback Planning**: Clear rollback strategy documented

**Example Integration Plan**:
```markdown
## Large Feature Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Core API Changes
- **Repository**: backend-api
- **Reviewers**: @backend-team, @api-team
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration  
- **Repository**: frontend-app
- **Reviewers**: @frontend-team, @ux-team
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete

### Phase 3: Database Migrations
- **Repository**: infrastructure
- **Reviewers**: @dba-team, @devops-team
- **Risk**: High - requires production deployment coordination
```

### Advanced QMS Commands

#### Workflow Management
```bash
# Check detailed status
@qms-bot detailed-status

# Request specific reviewer
@qms-bot assign-reviewer @expert-dev --expertise security

# Extend SLA with justification
@qms-bot extend-sla 48h --reason="Complex integration requiring extended testing"

# Request architecture review
@qms-bot architecture-review --priority high
```

#### Quality Gate Management
```bash
# Request gate exemption (requires approval)
@qms-bot exempt-gate coverage --justification="Legacy code refactor - comprehensive integration tests added"

# Re-run specific quality gate
@qms-bot rerun-gate security

# Get quality gate details
@qms-bot gate-details performance
```
