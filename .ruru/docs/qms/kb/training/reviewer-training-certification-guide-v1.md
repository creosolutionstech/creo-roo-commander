- **Gold Reviewer**: Expert reviewer who mentors others and handles critical reviews

## Module 1: Advanced Code Review Principles

### 1.1 The QMS Review Framework

Code review within the QMS framework goes beyond simple bug detection. It encompasses:

**Quality Dimensions:**
- **Correctness**: Logic validation and requirement compliance
- **Security**: Vulnerability identification and risk assessment
- **Performance**: Efficiency analysis and optimization opportunities
- **Maintainability**: Code structure, readability, and long-term sustainability
- **Compliance**: Standards adherence and regulatory requirements

**Review Responsibilities:**

**Primary Responsibilities:**
1. **Technical Validation**: Ensure code correctness and efficiency
2. **Security Assessment**: Identify and prevent security vulnerabilities
3. **Standards Compliance**: Verify adherence to coding and quality standards
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Share expertise and mentor team members
5. **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Validate automated quality gate results

**Secondary Responsibilities:**
1. **Process Improvement**: Identify and suggest workflow enhancements
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure appropriate documentation quality
3. **Test Coverage Validation**: Verify comprehensive test implementation
4. **Architecture Alignment**: Confirm design pattern compliance

### 1.2 Review Quality Standards

**Thoroughness Requirements:**
- Complete code path analysis (100% of changed lines)
- Context understanding (related files and dependencies)
- Impact assessment (potential effects on other systems)
- Edge case consideration (error conditions and boundary cases)

**Consistency Standards:**
- Standardized review checklist usage
- Consistent feedback terminology and severity levels
- Uniform application of quality criteria across all reviews
- Documented rationale for all significant review decisions

**Timeliness Expectations:**
- Initial review within 24 hours of submission
- Follow-up reviews within 4 hours of resubmission
- Complex reviews escalated appropriately when exceeding time limits
- Clear communication of review delays and expected completion

### 1.3 Effective Feedback Principles

**Constructive Feedback Framework:**

**The SBI-I Model:**
- **Situation**: Describe the specific code context
- **Behavior**: Explain the observed issue or concern
- **Impact**: Articulate the potential consequences
- **Intent**: Suggest specific improvements or alternatives

**Example Application:**
```markdown
**Situation**: In the user authentication function (lines 45-52)
**Behavior**: The password is being compared using direct string equality
**Impact**: This approach is vulnerable to timing attacks and doesn't use secure hashing
**Intent**: Consider using bcrypt.compare() for secure password verification

```typescript
// Instead of:
if (user.password === inputPassword) { ... }

// Use:
if (await bcrypt.compare(inputPassword, user.hashedPassword)) { ... }
```
```

**Feedback Categories and Severity:**

**Critical (Must Fix):**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors that cause incorrect behavior
- Compliance violations
- Data corruption risks

**Important (Should Fix):**
- Performance issues
- Maintainability concerns
- Design pattern violations
- Incomplete error handling

**Suggestion (Consider):**
- Code optimization opportunities
- Alternative implementation approaches
- Documentation improvements
- Style consistency enhancements

### 1.4 Review Process Integration

**Pre-Review Preparation:**
1. **Context Gathering**: Understand the feature/fix purpose and requirements
2. **Automated Gate Review**: Analyze automated quality gate results
3. **Related Change Analysis**: Review related PRs and recent changes
4. **Documentation Review**: Examine associated documentation updates

**Review Execution:**
1. **Systematic Analysis**: Follow standardized review checklist
2. **Code Path Tracing**: Trace through all execution paths
3. **Integration Impact**: Assess impact on existing functionality
4. **Test Validation**: Verify test coverage and quality

**Post-Review Actions:**
1. **Feedback Delivery**: Provide clear, actionable feedback
2. **Discussion Facilitation**: Engage in constructive dialogue with author
3. **Follow-up Tracking**: Monitor resolution of identified issues
4. **Knowledge Documentation**: Record lessons learned and patterns

## Module 2: Security Review Mastery

### 2.1 Security Vulnerability Identification

**Common Vulnerability Categories:**

**Injection Attacks:**
```typescript
// Vulnerable: SQL Injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${userEmail}'`;

// Secure: Parameterized Query
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?';
const result = await db.query(query, [userEmail]);
```

**Authentication and Authorization:**
```typescript
// Vulnerable: Weak JWT Secret
const token = jwt.sign(payload, 'secret123');

// Secure: Strong Secret Management
const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
  expiresIn: '15m',
  algorithm: 'HS256'
});
```

**Data Exposure:**
```typescript
// Vulnerable: Sensitive Data in Logs
console.log('User login:', { email, password, creditCard });

// Secure: Sanitized Logging
console.log('User login:', { email, timestamp: Date.now() });
```

**Input Validation:**
```typescript
// Vulnerable: No Input Validation
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  const user = new User(req.body);
  user.save();
});

// Secure: Comprehensive Validation
app.post('/api/users', [
  body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),
  body('password').isLength({ min: 8 }).matches(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/),
  body('age').isInt({ min: 13, max: 120 })
], (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
  }
  // Process validated input
});
```

## Module 3: Performance Review Excellence

### 3.1 Performance Analysis Techniques

**Performance Review Areas:**

**Algorithmic Efficiency:**
```typescript
// Inefficient: O(n²) complexity
function findDuplicates(arr: number[]): number[] {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j] && !duplicates.includes(arr[i])) {
        duplicates.push(arr[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}

// Efficient: O(n) complexity
function findDuplicates(arr: number[]): number[] {
  const seen = new Set<number>();
  const duplicates = new Set<number>();
  
  for (const num of arr) {
    if (seen.has(num)) {
      duplicates.add(num);
    } else {
      seen.add(num);
    }
  }
  
  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```

**Memory Management:**
```typescript
// Memory Leak Risk
class DataProcessor {
  private cache = new Map<string, any>();
  
  processData(id: string, data: any) {
    // Cache grows indefinitely
    this.cache.set(id, this.processExpensiveOperation(data));
    return this.cache.get(id);
  }
}

// Memory Efficient
class DataProcessor {
  private cache = new LRUCache<string, any>({ max: 1000 });
  
  processData(id: string, data: any) {
    if (!this.cache.has(id)) {
      this.cache.set(id, this.processExpensiveOperation(data));
    }
    return this.cache.get(id);
  }
}
```

**Database Query Optimization:**
```sql
-- Inefficient: No indexes, multiple queries
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE user_id = ?;
SELECT * FROM permissions WHERE user_id = ?;

-- Efficient: Optimized join with indexes
SELECT u.*, p.*, perm.permissions 
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT user_id, JSON_ARRAYAGG(permission_name) as permissions
  FROM permissions
  GROUP BY user_id
) perm ON u.id = perm.user_id
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com';
```

**Solution Discussion:**
Major security issues to identify:
1. Plain-text password comparison
2. Hard-coded JWT secret
3. No rate limiting
4. Sensitive data exposure in response
5. Missing input validation
6. Insecure cookie configuration
7. No CSRF protection

### Exercise 2: Performance Analysis Challenge

**Scenario:** Review a data processing service with performance concerns.

**Code Sample:**
```typescript
export class DataProcessor {
  async processUserData(userIds: string[]): Promise<ProcessedData[]> {
    const results = [];
    
    for (const userId of userIds) {
      const user = await User.findById(userId);
      const profile = await Profile.findOne({ userId });
      const permissions = await Permission.find({ userId });
      const activities = await Activity.find({ userId })
        .sort({ createdAt: -1 })
        .limit(100);
      
      const processed = {
        user: this.sanitizeUser(user),
        profile: this.processProfile(profile),
        permissions: permissions.map(p => p.name),
        activityCount: activities.length,
        lastActivity: activities[0]?.createdAt
      };
      
      results.push(processed);
    }
    
    return results;
  }
}
```

**Your Task:** Identify performance issues and suggest optimizations.

**Performance Issues to Address:**
1. N+1 query problem
2. Sequential processing instead of parallel
3. Inefficient database queries
4. No caching mechanism
5. Potential memory issues with large datasets

### Exercise 3: Architecture Review Simulation

**Scenario:** Review a microservice integration implementation.

**Code Sample:**
```typescript
export class OrderService {
  constructor(
    private userService: UserService,
    private inventoryService: InventoryService,
    private paymentService: PaymentService
  ) {}
  
  async createOrder(orderData: CreateOrderRequest): Promise<Order> {
    // Validate user
    const user = await this.userService.getUser(orderData.userId);
    if (!user) throw new Error('User not found');
    
    // Check inventory
    for (const item of orderData.items) {
      const available = await this.inventoryService.checkAvailability(item.productId);
      if (available < item.quantity) {
        throw new Error(`Insufficient inventory for ${item.productId}`);
      }
    }
    
    // Process payment
    const payment = await this.paymentService.processPayment({
      amount: this.calculateTotal(orderData.items),
      userId: orderData.userId
    });
    
    // Create order
    const order = await Order.create({
      ...orderData,
      paymentId: payment.id,
      status: 'confirmed'
    });
    
    // Update inventory
    for (const item of orderData.items) {
      await this.inventoryService.reserveInventory(item.productId, item.quantity);
    }
    
    return order;
  }
}
```

**Architecture Issues to Evaluate:**
1. Tight coupling between services
2. No transaction management
3. Inconsistent error handling
4. No compensation patterns for failures
5. Missing observability and monitoring
