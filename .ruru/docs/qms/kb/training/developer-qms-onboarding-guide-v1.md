- Learn to implement Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD) criteria
- Develop proficiency with automated quality gates and tooling
- Gain competency in QMS-integrated code review processes
- Build skills in compliance monitoring and issue resolution

## Module 1: QMS Foundation and Concepts

### 1.1 What is QMS?

The Quality Management System (QMS) is a comprehensive framework designed to ensure consistent quality, compliance, and efficiency across all development activities. It integrates seamlessly into your existing workflow while providing structured quality assurance processes.

**Core QMS Principles:**
- **Quality by Design**: Built-in quality measures from project inception
- **Continuous Improvement**: Iterative refinement based on metrics and feedback
- **Process Standardization**: Consistent practices across teams and projects
- **Risk Management**: Proactive identification and mitigation of quality risks
- **Compliance Assurance**: Automated verification of standards adherence

### 1.2 QMS Components Overview

**Quality Gates**: Automated checkpoints that validate code quality at different stages
- Static code analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance benchmarking
- Test coverage validation
- Documentation completeness checks

**Review Processes**: Structured workflows for human validation
- Definition of Ready (DoR) validation
- Code review protocols
- Definition of Done (DoD) verification
- Compliance auditing procedures

**Monitoring Systems**: Continuous tracking of quality metrics
- Quality trend analysis
- Team performance indicators
- Compliance reporting
- Issue tracking and resolution

### 1.3 Benefits for Developers

**Immediate Benefits:**

- Career development through quality-focused practices

**Team Benefits:**
- Consistent quality across all team members
- Reduced onboarding time for new developers
- Better predictability in delivery timelines
- Improved customer satisfaction through quality assurance

### 1.4 QMS Integration Philosophy

QMS is designed to **enhance**, not **hinder** your development process:

- **Non-intrusive**: Works within existing Git/GitHub workflows
- **Configurable**: Adapts to different project requirements and team preferences
- **Transparent**: Provides clear visibility into quality metrics and decisions
- **Collaborative**: Facilitates knowledge sharing and team learning

## Module 2: The 4-Step QMS Review Workflow

The QMS review workflow consists of four sequential steps that guide every code change from conception to deployment.

### 2.1 Step 1: Definition of Ready (DoR) Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure all prerequisites are met before development begins

**Key Validation Points:**
- Requirements clarity and completeness
- Acceptance criteria definition
- Technical approach approval
- Resource availability confirmation
- Dependency identification and resolution

**Developer Actions:**
1. Review task requirements thoroughly
2. Verify all acceptance criteria are clear and testable
3. Confirm technical approach with team/lead
4. Identify and document any dependencies
5. Ensure development environment is properly configured

**DoR Checklist Example:**
```markdown
- [ ] Requirements are clearly defined and understood
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Technical approach has been discussed and approved
- [ ] All necessary resources are available
- [ ] Dependencies have been identified and planned
- [ ] Development environment is configured
- [ ] Relevant documentation has been reviewed
```

**Common DoR Issues and Solutions:**
- **Vague Requirements**: Request clarification from product owner/stakeholders
- **Missing Dependencies**: Coordinate with relevant teams to resolve
- **Resource Constraints**: Escalate to team lead or project manager
- **Technical Uncertainty**: Schedule technical design session

### 2.2 Step 2: Automated Quality Gates

**Purpose**: Validate code quality through automated analysis before human review

**Quality Gate Categories:**

**Code Quality Gates:**
- Code coverage minimum thresholds (typically 80%+)
- Cyclomatic complexity limits
- Code duplication detection
- Coding standards compliance
- Documentation coverage requirements

**Security Gates:**
- Vulnerability scanning (SAST/DAST)
- Dependency security analysis
- Credential leak detection
- Security policy compliance
- Access control validation

**Performance Gates:**
- Build time optimization
- Runtime performance benchmarks
- Memory usage analysis
- Load testing validation
- Resource utilization checks

**Integration Gates:**
- API compatibility verification
- Database migration validation
- Configuration consistency checks
- Environment-specific testing
- Backwards compatibility analysis

**Developer Best Practices:**
1. **Run Quality Gates Locally**: Use pre-commit hooks and local tooling
2. **Monitor Gate Results**: Address failures promptly
3. **Understand Gate Criteria**: Learn why each gate exists and its importance
4. **Optimize for Gates**: Write code that naturally passes quality criteria

**Quality Gate Failure Resolution:**

```yaml
# Example Quality Gate Configuration
quality_gates:
  code_coverage:
    threshold: 80
    action_on_failure: "block_merge"
    
  security_scan:
    severity_threshold: "medium"
    action_on_failure: "require_review"
    
  performance:
    max_build_time: "300s"
    action_on_failure: "warn"
```

### 2.3 Step 3: Human Code Review

**Purpose**: Validate code quality, design decisions, and knowledge transfer through peer review

**Review Focus Areas:**

**Technical Review:**
- Code correctness and logic validation

## Module 3: Quality Standards Implementation

### 3.1 Coding Standards and Best Practices

**Code Structure Standards:**
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper indentation and formatting
- Logical code organization
- Appropriate commenting practices

**Language-Specific Guidelines:**

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
```typescript
// Good: Clear function naming and structure
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}

class UserService {
  /**
   * Retrieves user profile with caching
   * @param userId - Unique user identifier
   * @returns Promise resolving to user profile
   */
  async getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile> {
    try {
      return await this.cacheService.getOrSet(
        `user:${userId}`,
        () => this.userRepository.findById(userId),
        { ttl: 300 }
      );
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error('Failed to retrieve user profile', { userId, error });
      throw new UserRetrievalError('Profile access failed', { userId });
    }
  }
}
```

**Python:**
```python
# Good: Following PEP 8 and type hints
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
import logging

class DataProcessor:
    """Handles data transformation and validation."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self.config = config
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    
    def process_data(
        self, 
        raw_data: Dict[str, Any], 
        validation_rules: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Process and validate raw data according to rules.
        
        Args:
            raw_data: Input data to process
            validation_rules: Optional validation configuration
            
        Returns:
            Processed and validated data
            
        Raises:
            ValidationError: When data fails validation
        """
        try:
            validated_data = self._validate_data(raw_data, validation_rules)
            processed_data = self._transform_data(validated_data)
            return processed_data
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Data processing failed: {e}")
            raise
```

**Go:**
```go
// Good: Clear error handling and documentation
package user

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log/slog"
    "time"
)

// Service handles user operations
type Service struct {
    repo   Repository
    cache  Cache
    logger *slog.Logger
}

// GetProfile retrieves a user profile with caching
func (s *Service) GetProfile(ctx context.Context, userID string) (*Profile, error) {
    if userID == "" {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("user ID cannot be empty")
    }

    // Try cache first
    if profile, err := s.cache.Get(ctx, userID); err == nil {
        return profile, nil
    }

    // Fetch from repository
    profile, err := s.repo.GetByID(ctx, userID)
    if err != nil {
        s.logger.Error("failed to get user profile", 
            "user_id", userID, 
            "error", err)
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("profile retrieval failed: %w", err)
    }

    // Cache for future requests
    s.cache.Set(ctx, userID, profile, 5*time.Minute)
    
    return profile, nil
}
```

### 3.2 Testing Standards

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockRepository = createMockUserRepository();
    mockCache = createMockCacheService();
    userService = new UserService(mockRepository, mockCache);
  });

  describe('getUserProfile', () => {
    it('should return cached profile when available', async () => {
      const userId = 'user-123';
      const cachedProfile = createMockUserProfile(userId);
      mockCache.getOrSet.mockResolvedValue(cachedProfile);

      const result = await userService.getUserProfile(userId);

      expect(result).toEqual(cachedProfile);
      expect(mockCache.getOrSet).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        `user:${userId}`,
        expect.any(Function),
        { ttl: 300 }
      );
    });

    it('should handle repository errors gracefully', async () => {
      const userId = 'user-123';
      const repositoryError = new Error('Database connection failed');
      mockCache.getOrSet.mockRejectedValue(repositoryError);

      await expect(userService.getUserProfile(userId))
        .rejects.toThrow(UserRetrievalError);
    });

    it('should validate input parameters', async () => {
      await expect(userService.getUserProfile(''))
        .rejects.toThrow('User ID cannot be empty');
    });
  });
});
```

**Integration Tests:**
```typescript
// Example: API integration test
describe('User API Integration', () => {
  let app: Application;
  let testDb: TestDatabase;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    testDb = await createTestDatabase();
    app = createTestApplication({ database: testDb });
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await testDb.cleanup();
  });

  describe('GET /api/users/:id', () => {
    it('should return user profile for valid ID', async () => {
      const user = await testDb.createUser({
        email: 'test@example.com',
        name: 'Test User'
      });

      const response = await request(app)
        .get(`/api/users/${user.id}`)
        .expect(200);

      expect(response.body).toMatchObject({
        id: user.id,
        email: user.email,
        name: user.name
      });
    });

    it('should return 404 for non-existent user', async () => {
      await request(app)
        .get('/api/users/non-existent-id')
        .expect(404);
    });
  });
});
```

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

class QualityGateChecker {
  constructor() {
    this.criteria = {
      coverage: {
        lines: 80,

## Module 5: Practical Exercises and Hands-on Practice

### Exercise 1: DoR Validation Practice

**Scenario:** You've been assigned a new user story for implementing a user notification system.

**User Story:**
```
As a user, I want to receive notifications about important account activities 
so that I can stay informed about my account status.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Users should receive email notifications for password changes
- Users should receive in-app notifications for security alerts
- Users should be able to configure notification preferences
```

**Your Task:** Complete the DoR validation checklist and identify any gaps.

**DoR Checklist:**
```markdown
- [ ] Requirements are clearly defined and understood
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Technical approach has been discussed and approved
- [ ] All necessary resources are available
- [ ] Dependencies have been identified and planned
- [ ] Development environment is configured
- [ ] Relevant documentation has been reviewed
```

**Solution Discussion:**
- **Requirements Clarity**: The story lacks specific details about notification timing, format, and failure handling
- **Technical Dependencies**: Need to identify email service, database schema changes, and authentication requirements
- **Resources**: Verify access to email service credentials and notification service APIs

### Exercise 2: Automated Quality Gate Configuration

**Scenario:** Configure quality gates for a new TypeScript project.

**Your Task:** Create a comprehensive quality gate configuration that includes:
- Code coverage thresholds
- ESLint rule enforcement
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance benchmarks

**Solution:**
```json
// jest.config.js
{
  "collectCoverageFrom": [
    "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "!src/**/*.d.ts",
    "!src/test-utils/**/*"
  ],
  "coverageThreshold": {
    "global": {
      "branches": 80,
      "functions": 80,
      "lines": 80,
      "statements": 80
    },
    "src/core/": {
      "branches": 90,
      "functions": 90,
      "lines": 90,
      "statements": 90
    }
  }
}
```

```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": [
    "@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:security/recommended",
    "plugin:sonarjs/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "complexity": ["error", 10],
    "max-depth": ["error", 4],
    "max-lines-per-function": ["error", 50],
    "security/detect-object-injection": "error",
    "sonarjs/cognitive-complexity": ["error", 15]
  }
}
```

### Exercise 3: Code Review Simulation

**Scenario:** You're reviewing a pull request that implements user authentication.

**Pull Request Code:**
```typescript
// auth.service.ts
export class AuthService {
  login(email, password) {
    if (!email || !password) {
      throw new Error('Missing credentials');
    }
    
    const user = this.userService.findByEmail(email);
    if (user && user.password === password) {
      const token = Math.random().toString(36);
      return { token, user };
    }
    
    throw new Error('Invalid credentials');
  }
}
```

**Your Task:** Identify quality issues and provide constructive feedback.

**Review Feedback Example:**
```markdown
**Security Issues:**
- ❌ Plain text password comparison (use bcrypt)
- ❌ Weak token generation (use crypto-secure random)
- ❌ No rate limiting for login attempts

**Code Quality:**
- ❌ Missing type annotations
- ❌ Insufficient error handling
- ❌ No input validation/sanitization

**Suggestions:**
```typescript
export class AuthService {
  async login(email: string, password: string): Promise<AuthResult> {
    // Input validation
    if (!this.isValidEmail(email) || !password?.trim()) {
      throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid credentials format');
    }
    
    try {
      const user = await this.userService.findByEmail(email);
      if (!user || !await bcrypt.compare(password, user.hashedPassword)) {
        // Log failed attempt for security monitoring
        this.securityLogger.logFailedLogin(email);
        throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid credentials');
      }
      
      const token = await this.tokenService.generateSecureToken(user.id);
      return { token, user: this.sanitizeUser(user) };
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error('Login failed', { email, error });
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
```

### Exercise 4: DoD Validation Practice

**Scenario:** Your feature implementation is complete. Validate against DoD criteria.

**Feature:** User profile picture upload functionality

**Your Task:** Complete the DoD checklist:

```markdown
**Functional Requirements:**
- [ ] Users can upload profile pictures
- [ ] Images are resized and optimized
- [ ] Old profile pictures are cleaned up
- [ ] Upload progress is displayed

**Quality Standards:**
- [ ] Unit tests cover all scenarios
