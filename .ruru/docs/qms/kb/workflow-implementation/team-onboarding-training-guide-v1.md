## Team Role-Specific Learning Paths

### 1. Developers (Frontend/Backend/Full-Stack)

#### Phase 1: QMS Fundamentals (Week 1-2)

**Module 1.1: QMS Introduction (2 hours)**
```markdown
# QMS Developer Fundamentals

## What is QMS?
The Quality Management System (QMS) is our comprehensive framework for ensuring 
code quality, security, and reliability throughout the development lifecycle.

## Core Benefits for Developers:
- **Automated Quality Checks**: Catch issues early in development
- **Clear Standards**: Know exactly what constitutes "done"
- **Faster Reviews**: Streamlined review processes
- **Reduced Rework**: Higher first-time quality

## The 4-Step Workflow:

### Step 1: Definition of Ready (DoR)
**Your Role:** Ensure PRs meet basic requirements before review
- Conventional commit messages
- Adequate PR descriptions
- Linked to relevant issues
- Basic linting and security scans pass

### Step 2: Progress Monitoring
**Your Role:** Maintain quality during development
- Keep builds green
- Maintain test coverage
- Address security vulnerabilities promptly
- Follow coding standards

### Step 3: Definition of Done (DoD)
**Your Role:** Comprehensive validation before merge
- All tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)
- Security compliance verified
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated

### Step 4: Final QMS Review
**Your Role:** Support final quality assessment
- Respond to review feedback
- Provide context for changes
- Ensure business requirements met
```

**Module 1.2: Quality Gates Deep Dive (3 hours)**
```markdown
# Understanding Quality Gates

## What Are Quality Gates?
Automated checkpoints that enforce quality standards at different stages
of the development process.

## Gate Categories:

### Blocking Gates (Must Pass)
- **Security Scans**: No critical vulnerabilities
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage
- **Build Success**: Code compiles and builds successfully
- **Lint Compliance**: Code follows style guidelines

### Warning Gates (Advisory)
- **Code Complexity**: Warns about overly complex functions
- **Performance Impact**: Alerts about potential slowdowns
- **Documentation Coverage**: Suggests documentation improvements

### Conditional Gates (Context-Specific)
- **Database Migrations**: Additional validation for schema changes
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Extra review for deployment configs
- **API Changes**: Breaking change analysis

## Developer Actions:

### When Gates Fail:
1. **Review Failure Details**: Check gate logs and error messages
2. **Fix Root Cause**: Address the underlying issue, not just symptoms
3. **Re-run Validation**: Trigger gate re-execution after fixes
4. **Seek Help**: Escalate to team leads if stuck

### Best Practices:
- **Run Gates Locally**: Use pre-commit hooks for early detection
- **Incremental Fixes**: Address issues in small, focused commits
- **Learn from Failures**: Understand why gates fail to prevent recurrence
```

**Practical Exercise 1.1: Creating Quality PRs**
```markdown
# Exercise: Create Your First QMS-Compliant PR

## Scenario:
You need to implement a new user authentication endpoint.

## Tasks:
1. **Setup Local Environment**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   cd <project>
   npm install
   npm run setup:qms-hooks
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/user-authentication
   ```

3. **Implement with Quality in Mind**
   - Write the authentication logic
   - Add comprehensive unit tests (aim for >90% coverage)
   - Include integration tests
   - Add JSDoc documentation
   - Follow existing code patterns

4. **Validate Locally Before PR**
   ```bash
   npm run lint:fix
   npm run test:coverage
   npm run security:scan
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Create QMS-Compliant PR**
   - Title: "feat(auth): add user authentication endpoint"
   - Description should include:
     - Summary of changes
     - Acceptance criteria
     - Testing approach
     - Security considerations
   - Link to related issues

## Success Criteria:
- All local quality gates pass
- PR metadata validation succeeds
- Code review approved
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
```

#### Phase 2: Advanced QMS Implementation (Week 3-4)

**Module 2.1: Testing Excellence (4 hours)**
```markdown
# QMS Testing Standards

## Testing Pyramid Compliance

### Unit Tests (Foundation)
**Coverage Requirement:** 80% minimum
**Focus Areas:**
- Business logic validation
- Edge case handling
- Error condition testing
- Mock external dependencies

**Example:**
```javascript
describe('UserAuthentication', () => {
  describe('validateCredentials', () => {
    it('should return true for valid credentials', async () => {
      const result = await auth.validateCredentials('user@test.com', 'password123');
      expect(result).toBe(true);
    });
    
    it('should return false for invalid password', async () => {
      const result = await auth.validateCredentials('user@test.com', 'wrongpass');
      expect(result).toBe(false);
    });
    
    it('should handle database errors gracefully', async () => {
      mockDB.findUser.mockRejectedValue(new Error('DB Error'));
      await expect(auth.validateCredentials('user@test.com', 'password123'))
        .rejects.toThrow('Authentication service unavailable');
    });
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests (Middle Layer)
**Coverage Requirement:** 70% minimum
**Focus Areas:**
- API endpoint testing
- Database integration
- Service communication
- Configuration validation

### End-to-End Tests (Top Layer)  
**Coverage Requirement:** 50% minimum
**Focus Areas:**
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance validation
- Accessibility compliance

## Test Quality Standards
- **Descriptive Names**: Tests should clearly describe what they validate
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Follow structured test patterns
- **Independent Tests**: Each test should run independently
- **Fast Execution**: Unit tests should complete in milliseconds
```

**Module 2.2: Security Best Practices (3 hours)**
```markdown
# Security in QMS Development

## Security Gates Overview

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
**Tools Used:**
- ESLint Security Plugin
- SonarQube Security Rules
- Semgrep

**Common Issues Caught:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Insecure cryptographic usage
- Hardcoded secrets

### Dependency Scanning
**Tools Used:**
- npm audit
- Snyk
- OWASP Dependency Check

**Best Practices:**
- Regular dependency updates
- Pin dependency versions
- Monitor security advisories
- Use minimal dependency sets

### Secret Detection
**Tools Used:**
- GitLeaks
- TruffleHog
- GitHub Secret Scanning

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Environment variable usage
- Secure secret management
- Pre-commit hooks
- Regular secret rotation

## Developer Security Responsibilities

### Secure Coding Practices
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Direct query construction
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// ✅ Good: Parameterized queries
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);

// ❌ Bad: Unvalidated input
app.post('/user', (req, res) => {
  const userData = req.body; // Direct usage
  createUser(userData);
});

// ✅ Good: Input validation
app.post('/user', validate(userSchema), (req, res) => {
  const userData = matchedData(req); // Validated data only
  createUser(userData);
});
```

### Security Testing
```javascript
// Security-focused test example
describe('Authentication Security', () => {
  it('should prevent SQL injection attacks', async () => {
    const maliciousInput = "'; DROP TABLE users; --";
    const result = await auth.login(maliciousInput, 'password');
    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    // Verify database integrity
    const userCount = await db.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users');
    expect(userCount).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });
  
  it('should rate limit login attempts', async () => {
    // Simulate multiple failed attempts
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      await auth.login('user@test.com', 'wrongpass');
    }
    
    const result = await auth.login('user@test.com', 'wrongpass');
    expect(result.error).toBe('Rate limit exceeded');
  });
});
```
```
