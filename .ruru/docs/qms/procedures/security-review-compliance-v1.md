# QMS Security Review and Compliance Procedures V1

## 1. Overview

This document defines comprehensive security review and compliance procedures within the Roo Commander QMS framework. These procedures ensure robust security validation, vulnerability management, threat mitigation, and regulatory compliance across all development activities by providing automated scanning, risk assessment, remediation workflows, and compliance tracking.

### 1.1 Integration Context

**Phase 2.4 Integration**: These procedures integrate seamlessly with the existing QMS infrastructure established in Phase 2.3:
- **4-step QMS review workflow**: Security review as Gate 3 (Security & Compliance Review)
- **DoR/DoD validation integration**: Security validation in both pre and post-development gates
- **GitHub PR automation**: Automated security scanning in pull request workflows
- **MDTM system integration**: Security compliance tracking in task management

### 1.2 Scope and Coverage

**Security Assessment Areas:**
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Source code vulnerability analysis
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Runtime vulnerability detection
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**: Third-party dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Infrastructure Security**: Container, cloud, and deployment security validation
- **Data Security**: Data protection, encryption, and privacy compliance

**Compliance Frameworks:**
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security risks
- **CIS Controls**: Center for Internet Security benchmarks
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management and security controls
- **SOC 2**: Service organization control requirements
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data privacy and protection regulations

### 1.3 Security Authority and Success Metrics

**Authority**: Mandatory security compliance - failing security checks block development progress
**Success Metrics**: 100% critical vulnerability remediation, 95% compliance validation rate
**Risk Tolerance**: Zero tolerance for high/critical vulnerabilities, managed tolerance for medium/low

## 2. Security Assessment Framework

### 2.1 Vulnerability Classification and Risk Matrix

#### **Critical Vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**

**Classification Criteria:**
- Remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities
- SQL injection with data access/modification capability
- Authentication bypass allowing administrative access
- Insecure cryptographic implementations exposing sensitive data
- Directory traversal with system file access

**Risk Impact Assessment:**
```toml
[critical_vulnerability_impact]
business_impact = "severe" # Potential complete system compromise
data_exposure_risk = "high" # Sensitive data compromise likely
compliance_violation = "major" # Significant regulatory violations
reputation_damage = "high" # Severe brand and customer trust impact
financial_impact = "high" # Potential significant financial loss

[critical_response_requirements]
remediation_timeline = "4 hours" # Immediate action required
escalation_level = "executive" # C-level notification required
deployment_blocking = true # All deployments blocked until resolved
emergency_response = true # Security incident response activated
external_notification = "conditional" # Based on data exposure assessment
```

#### **High Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**

**Classification Criteria:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) with sensitive data access
- Insecure direct object references with privilege escalation
- Security misconfigurations exposing internal systems
- Weak authentication mechanisms allowing unauthorized access
- Insecure data transmission without encryption

**Risk Impact Assessment:**
```toml
[high_vulnerability_impact]
business_impact = "significant" # Major system functionality compromise
data_exposure_risk = "medium_high" # Some sensitive data at risk
compliance_violation = "moderate" # Potential regulatory concerns
reputation_damage = "medium" # Noticeable customer confidence impact
financial_impact = "medium" # Moderate financial exposure

[high_response_requirements]
remediation_timeline = "24 hours" # Urgent action required
escalation_level = "management" # VP/Director notification required
deployment_blocking = "conditional" # Based on exposure assessment
emergency_response = false # Standard security process
external_notification = "assessment_based" # Case-by-case evaluation
```

#### **Medium Vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**

**Classification Criteria:**
- Information disclosure without sensitive data exposure
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) with limited impact
- Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities
- Weak password policies and session management
- Minor security misconfigurations

**Risk Impact Assessment:**
```toml
[medium_vulnerability_impact]
business_impact = "limited" # Partial functionality or data impact
data_exposure_risk = "low_medium" # Limited sensitive data risk
compliance_violation = "minor" # Minimal regulatory impact
reputation_damage = "low" # Limited customer impact
financial_impact = "low" # Minimal financial exposure

[medium_response_requirements]
remediation_timeline = "72 hours" # Planned remediation required
escalation_level = "technical_lead" # Team lead notification
deployment_blocking = false # Does not block deployments
emergency_response = false # Standard workflow
external_notification = false # Internal handling only
```

#### **Low Vulnerabilities (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**

**Classification Criteria:**
- Informational findings without immediate security impact
- Best practice recommendations and hardening opportunities
- Code quality issues with potential security implications
- Documentation and configuration improvements
- Non-exploitable security findings

**Risk Impact Assessment:**
```toml
[low_vulnerability_impact]
business_impact = "minimal" # No immediate business impact
data_exposure_risk = "negligible" # No sensitive data risk
compliance_violation = "none" # No regulatory concerns
reputation_damage = "none" # No customer impact
financial_impact = "none" # No financial exposure

[low_response_requirements]
remediation_timeline = "30 days" # Planned maintenance window
escalation_level = "developer" # Developer notification only
deployment_blocking = false # Does not block deployments
emergency_response = false # Standard maintenance
external_notification = false # Internal tracking only
```
