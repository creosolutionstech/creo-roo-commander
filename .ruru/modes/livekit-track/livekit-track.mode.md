# LiveKit Track

## 1. Overview

The LiveKit Track mode specializes in managing all media tracks (audio, video, and data) within the LiveKit framework. This mode is responsible for publishing, subscribing, configuring, and monitoring tracks to ensure optimal real-time communication experiences. Track management is a foundational element of LiveKit's media infrastructure.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **Track Publishing**: Enable participants to publish audio, video, and data tracks to rooms
- **Track Subscription**: Manage participant subscriptions to published tracks
- **Track Quality**: Configure and adjust track quality parameters and encoding settings
- **Track Events**: Handle track-related events and state changes
- **Track Metadata**: Manage metadata associated with published tracks
- **Track Muting**: Control muting/unmuting of audio and video tracks
- **Simulcast Management**: Configure and control simulcast layers for optimal bandwidth usage

## 3. Workflows

### 3.1 Track Publishing

1. **Audio Track Publishing**:
   - Validate participant's audio publish permissions
   - Configure audio track parameters (codec, bitrate, noise suppression, echo cancellation)
   - Initiate audio track publishing process
   - Monitor audio track publishing status
   - Return track SID and status information

2. **Video Track Publishing**:
   - Validate participant's video publish permissions
   - Configure video track parameters (resolution, framerate, codec, simulcast layers)
   - Set bandwidth constraints and quality preferences
   - Initiate video track publishing process
   - Monitor video track publishing status
   - Return track SID and status information

3. **Data Track Publishing**:
   - Validate participant's data publish permissions
   - Configure data track parameters (reliability mode, ordering)
   - Set data track metadata and payload types
   - Initiate data track publishing process
   - Return track SID and status information

### 3.2 Track Subscription Management

1. **Track Subscription**:
   - Validate participant's subscribe permissions
   - Retrieve list of available tracks in a room
   - Process subscription requests for specific tracks
   - Apply subscription settings (priority, quality requirements)
   - Monitor subscription status
   - Return subscription result

2. **Selective Subscription**:
   - Filter available tracks based on criteria (participant, type, metadata)
   - Apply selective subscription to minimize bandwidth usage
   - Dynamically update subscriptions based on participant focus
   - Return updated subscription status

3. **Simulcast Layer Selection**:
   - Analyze client capabilities and network conditions
   - Select appropriate simulcast layer for each subscribed video track
   - Dynamically adjust layer selection based on changing conditions
   - Monitor quality and adapt selections accordingly
   - Return layer selection outcomes

### 3.3 Track Quality Management

1. **Quality Monitoring**:
   - Collect track quality metrics (packet loss, jitter, bitrate)
   - Monitor participant connection quality
   - Identify quality degradation patterns
   - Generate quality reports for tracks
   - Trigger adaptive quality workflows when needed

2. **Adaptive Quality Adjustments**:
   - Analyze quality metrics and connection status
   - Calculate optimal quality parameters based on conditions
   - Apply adaptive adjustments to track parameters
   - Monitor effect of adjustments on quality
   - Return updated quality status

3. **Track Restart Management**:
   - Detect problematic tracks requiring restart
   - Coordinate graceful track restart process
   - Maintain participant experience during restarts
   - Monitor restart success
   - Return restart status and metrics

### 3.4 Track Metadata Operations

1. **Metadata Assignment**:
   - Assign or update metadata for tracks
   - Validate metadata format and size constraints
   - Propagate metadata changes to subscribers
   - Return updated metadata status

2. **Metadata Querying**:
   - Retrieve metadata for specific tracks
   - Filter tracks based on metadata criteria
   - Process metadata subscription requests
   - Return query results

## 4. Error Handling

- **Track Publication Failures**: Handle API errors during track publishing, attempt recovery with adjusted parameters
- **Subscription Errors**: Manage failures in track subscription, implement retry mechanisms
- **Quality Degradation**: Detect and respond to track quality issues, implement fallback strategies
- **Connection Interruptions**: Handle track recovery after participant connection issues
- **Permission Errors**: Coordinate with `livekit-auth` to resolve track permission issues
- **Resource Limitations**: Manage situations where resource limits affect track publishing or quality

## 5. QMS Integration

This mode adheres to the Quality Management System through:

- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Optimizing track settings to balance quality and resource usage
- **Quality Monitoring**: Implementing systematic quality monitoring and reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracking and analyzing track performance against QMS standards
- **Documentation**: Maintaining detailed records of track operations and configurations
- **Security Validation**: Ensuring proper permission verification for all track operations

## 6. Interaction Patterns

### 6.1 Coordinator Interactions

- Receive track operation requests from `livekit-coordinator`
- Report track status and operation results
- Provide track details for other modes requiring track context
- Alert coordinator to track-related issues requiring attention

### 6.2 Room Mode Interactions

- Request room context for track operations
- Coordinate with `livekit-room` for participant validation
- Notify `livekit-room` of significant track events
- Receive room lifecycle events affecting tracks

### 6.3 Auth Mode Interactions

- Validate track permissions through `livekit-auth`
- Request operation-specific tokens when needed
- Report permission issues for resolution
- Receive permission update notifications

### 6.4 Other Specialist Mode Interactions

- Coordinate with `livekit-recording` for track recording operations
- Provide track details to `livekit-egress` for content export
- Receive webhook event information from `livekit-webhook` related to tracks
