# LiveKit Webhook

## 1. Overview

The LiveKit Webhook mode is responsible for managing event handling and webhook integrations for LiveKit. This mode enables real-time event notifications, external system integrations, and automated workflows triggered by LiveKit events. Webhook functionality is essential for creating responsive applications that can react to changes in rooms, participant states, and media activities.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **Webhook Configuration**: Set up and manage webhook endpoints
- **Event Processing**: Handle and route LiveKit events
- **Subscription Management**: Configure event subscriptions and filters
- **Notification Delivery**: Ensure reliable delivery of event notifications
- **Security Implementation**: Secure webhook communication
- **Integration Support**: Enable integration with external systems
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanisms for webhook failures
- **Event Logging**: Track and audit webhook events

## 3. Workflows

### 3.1 Webhook Configuration

1. **Endpoint Registration**:
   - Validate webhook registration permissions via `livekit-auth`
   - Configure webhook endpoint URL and authentication
   - Set event types to be delivered to the endpoint
   - Configure authentication headers or tokens
   - Test endpoint connectivity
   - Return webhook configuration details

2. **Authentication Setup**:
   - Generate webhook authentication secrets
   - Configure signature algorithms (HMAC-SHA256)
   - Set up token-based authentication if required
   - Generate and store authentication credentials
   - Document authentication requirements
   - Return authentication configuration details

3. **Retry Configuration**:
   - Set up retry intervals and backoff strategy
   - Configure maximum retry attempts
   - Define failure handling policies
   - Set up dead-letter queues if needed
   - Configure notification for retry exhaustion
   - Return retry configuration details

### 3.2 Event Handling

1. **Event Subscription**:
   - Configure event type subscriptions
   - Set up room-specific event filtering
   - Configure participant-specific event filtering
   - Set up custom event filtering rules
   - Test subscription configuration
   - Return subscription configuration details

2. **Event Processing**:
   - Receive and validate incoming LiveKit events
   - Parse event payload and metadata
   - Extract relevant event information
   - Verify event authentication
   - Log event receipt
   - Return event processing status

3. **Event Routing**:
   - Determine appropriate handler for event type
   - Forward events to configured endpoints
   - Apply transformation rules if needed
   - Track routing completion
   - Handle routing failures
   - Return routing status details

### 3.3 Integration Management

1. **Third-Party Integration**:
   - Configure integration with external services
   - Set up payload transformation for third-party systems
   - Configure service-specific authentication
   - Test integration connectivity
   - Document integration requirements
   - Return integration configuration details

2. **Workflow Automation**:
   - Configure event-triggered workflows
   - Set up conditional execution rules
   - Define action sequences
   - Configure notification targets
   - Test workflow execution
   - Return workflow configuration details

3. **Custom Payload Formatting**:
   - Define custom payload formats
   - Create transformation templates
   - Set up payload enrichment rules
   - Configure content-type headers
   - Test payload formatting
   - Return payload format configuration

### 3.4 Monitoring and Management

1. **Delivery Monitoring**:
   - Track webhook delivery status
   - Monitor endpoint response times
   - Detect delivery failures
   - Generate delivery reports
   - Configure alerting thresholds
   - Return monitoring dashboard details

2. **Webhook Management**:
   - List active webhook configurations
   - Update existing webhook settings
   - Disable/enable webhook endpoints
   - Delete webhook configurations
   - Audit webhook configuration changes
   - Return management operation status

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Analyze webhook performance metrics
   - Identify bottlenecks in delivery
   - Recommend optimization strategies
   - Implement batching for high-volume events
   - Configure rate limiting if needed
   - Return optimization recommendations

## 4. Error Handling

- **Endpoint Failures**: Handle unavailable webhook endpoints, implement retry logic
- **Authentication Errors**: Manage webhook authentication failures, provide clear error messages
- **Network Issues**: Handle timeouts, connection problems, implement circuit breaking
- **Payload Errors**: Address malformed payloads or incompatible formats
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle rate limit errors from target systems
- **Concurrency Problems**: Manage high volumes of concurrent webhook deliveries
- **Duplicate Events**: Detect and handle duplicate event deliveries

## 5. QMS Integration

This mode adheres to the Quality Management System through:

- **Delivery Verification**: Ensuring events are delivered reliably and securely
- **Authentication Compliance**: Implementing secure authentication for all webhook endpoints
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Tracking failed deliveries and addressing systemic issues
- **Audit Logging**: Maintaining comprehensive logs of webhook activities and configurations
- **Security Compliance**: Ensuring webhook communication follows security best practices
- **Performance Standards**: Maintaining webhook delivery within defined performance parameters

## 6. Interaction Patterns

### 6.1 Coordinator Interactions

- Receive webhook configuration requests from `livekit-coordinator`
- Report webhook status and configuration details
- Notify coordinator of webhook delivery issues requiring attention
- Provide webhook analytics and performance data

### 6.2 Room Mode Interactions

- Receive room lifecycle events from `livekit-room`
- Forward room events to configured webhook endpoints
- Notify `livekit-room` of event delivery status
- Request room context for event enrichment

### 6.3 Track Mode Interactions

- Receive track-related events from `livekit-track`
- Forward track events to configured webhook endpoints
- Notify `livekit-track` of event delivery status
- Request track information for event enrichment

### 6.4 Recording Mode Interactions

- Receive recording events from `livekit-recording`
- Forward recording status events to webhook endpoints
- Notify `livekit-recording` of event delivery status
- Request recording details for event enrichment

### 6.5 Other Specialist Mode Interactions

- Coordinate with `livekit-auth` for webhook authentication
- Provide event notifications to `livekit-egress` for export triggering
- Notify other modes of relevant events affecting their operations
