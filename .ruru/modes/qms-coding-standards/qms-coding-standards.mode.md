# QMS Coding Standards Mode

## Overview

The **QMS Coding Standards** mode is the central enforcement engine for coding quality across the entire Roo Commander ecosystem. It provides comprehensive, multi-language validation with AI-augmented capabilities to ensure all code meets Creo QMS standards.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Multi-Language Standards Enforcement

**Supported Languages:**
- **Go**: SOLID principles, effective Go patterns, concurrency safety
- **Python**: PEP 8/257, type hints, performance best practices
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: ESLint rules, React patterns, accessibility
- **Rust**: Ownership safety, performance optimization, async patterns
- **Java**: Spring Boot patterns, testing standards, security practices

### 2. AI-Augmented Validation

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Automatic detection of code quality issues
- Context-aware suggestions for improvements
- Learning from team coding patterns
- Predictive identification of potential problems

**Smart Suggestions:**
- Real-time code improvement recommendations
- Multiple solution options with explanations
- Integration with existing codebase patterns
- Performance and security considerations

### 3. Automated Quality Gates

**Pre-Commit Hooks:**
- Standards compliance validation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Complexity threshold checking
- Documentation completeness verification

**CI/CD Integration:**
- GitHub Actions workflow integration
- Branch protection rule enforcement
- Automated PR quality gates
- Compliance reporting and metrics

### 4. Real-Time Development Support

**IDE Integration:**
- Real-time syntax and style validation
- Inline suggestions and fixes
- Context-aware documentation links
- Performance optimization hints

**Development Workflow:**
- Automatic formatting on save
- Intelligent import organization
- Code template suggestions
- Best practice reminders

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Automatic Validation

The mode automatically validates code when:
- Files are saved in the IDE
- Pre-commit hooks are triggered
- Pull requests are created
- Manual validation is requested

### 2. Interactive Mode

```bash
# Manual validation request
roo qms-coding-standards validate --file src/main.go --language go

# Get standards for specific language
roo qms-coding-standards standards --language python --topic security

# Generate compliance report
roo qms-coding-standards report --format md --output qms-report.md
```

### 3. Integration with Development Modes

```toml
# In dev-golang.mode.md
[enhancements]
qms_integration = true
standards_validation = "pre-commit"
ai_suggestions = true
compliance_reporting = true
```

## Standards Categories

### 3. Security Standards

**Vulnerability Prevention:**
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF mitigation

**Secure Coding:**
- Authentication/authorization
- Data encryption
- Secure communication
- Audit logging

### 4. Testing Standards

**Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit test coverage â‰¥80%
- Integration test coverage
- E2E test scenarios
- Performance test baselines

**Test Quality:**
- AAA pattern compliance
- Mock/stub best practices
- Deterministic test execution
- Proper test isolation

moderate = { warnings_as_errors = false, allow_suppressions = true }
lenient = { warnings_as_errors = false, allow_suppressions = true, auto_fix = true }
```

## Integration Examples

### 1. GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/qms-validation.yml
name: QMS Standards Validation
on: [pull_request, push]

jobs:
  qms-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: QMS Standards Check
        run: npx roo-cli qms-coding-standards validate --all
      - name: AI Pattern Analysis
        run: npx roo-cli qms-coding-standards ai-analyze
      - name: Generate Compliance Report
        run: npx roo-cli qms-coding-standards report --output qms-report.md
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hook Integration

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash

# Run QMS validation
npx roo-cli qms-coding-standards validate --staged

# Check exit code
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "QMS validation failed. Please fix standards violations."
    exit 1
fi
```
