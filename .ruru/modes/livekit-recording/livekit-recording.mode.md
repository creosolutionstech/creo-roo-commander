# LiveKit Recording

## 1. Overview

The LiveKit Recording mode is responsible for managing all recording operations within the LiveKit framework. This mode enables the capture, storage, and transcription of audio, video, and data shared during LiveKit sessions. Recording functionality is essential for archiving meetings, creating educational content, and providing compliance solutions.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **Recording Initiation**: Start recording sessions with appropriate configurations
- **Recording Management**: Control ongoing recordings, including pause, resume, and stop operations
- **Transcription**: Generate text transcriptions of audio content
- **Storage Management**: Configure and monitor storage for recorded media
- **Format Handling**: Support various output formats and quality settings
- **Metadata**: Attach and manage metadata for recordings
- **Compliance**: Ensure recordings meet legal and regulatory requirements

## 3. Workflows

### 3.1 Recording Initiation

1. **Room Recording Setup**:
   - Validate recording permissions via `livekit-auth`
   - Get room context from `livekit-room`
   - Configure recording parameters (format, quality, storage location)
   - Set participant visibility rules
   - Initiate room-wide recording
   - Return recording ID and status information

2. **Track-Specific Recording**:
   - Validate track recording permissions
   - Obtain track information from `livekit-track`
   - Configure track recording parameters
   - Start track-specific recording
   - Monitor track recording status
   - Return track recording ID and status

3. **Composite Recording**:
   - Configure layout and composition settings
   - Set inclusion/exclusion rules for participants
   - Initialize composite recording with selected tracks
   - Apply visual templates if specified
   - Start composite recording process
   - Return composite recording ID and status

### 3.2 Recording Management

1. **Monitoring and Status**:
   - Retrieve current recording status
   - Monitor storage usage and capacity
   - Track recording duration
   - Report on recording health
   - Generate status reports

2. **Pause and Resume Control**:
   - Process pause requests
   - Ensure clean break points
   - Maintain recording metadata during pauses
   - Handle resume operations
   - Manage recording timeline integrity
   - Return updated recording status

3. **Recording Termination**:
   - Process stop recording requests
   - Ensure proper finalization of recording files
   - Trigger post-processing workflows
   - Generate recording completion event
   - Return final recording details

### 3.3 Transcription Operations

1. **Real-Time Transcription**:
   - Initialize speech-to-text service connection
   - Configure language and specialized vocabulary
   - Process audio streams in real-time
   - Generate timestamped transcripts
   - Provide interim transcription results
   - Return transcription status and data

2. **Post-Recording Transcription**:
   - Process completed recording for transcription
   - Apply advanced transcription settings
   - Handle speaker identification
   - Generate formatted transcript with metadata
   - Support multiple output formats
   - Return completed transcript location

3. **Transcription Correction**:
   - Process transcription correction requests
   - Apply manual or automated corrections
   - Update transcription data
   - Maintain version history of transcripts
   - Return updated transcription status

### 3.4 Storage and Retrieval

1. **Storage Configuration**:
   - Set storage location and retention policies
   - Configure backup options
   - Apply encryption settings
   - Set access control policies
   - Return storage configuration status

2. **Recording Retrieval**:
   - Process recording access requests
   - Validate access permissions
   - Generate access URLs or download packages
   - Track access events
   - Return recording access details

## 4. Error Handling

- **Recording Initialization Failures**: Handle API errors during recording start, attempt recovery with adjusted parameters
- **Storage Limitations**: Manage situations where storage limits are reached during recording
- **Transcription Errors**: Handle failures in speech recognition, implement fallback mechanisms
- **Connection Interruptions**: Manage recording recovery after connection issues
- **Concurrency Issues**: Handle multiple simultaneous recording operations
- **Format Compatibility**: Resolve issues with output format compatibility

## 5. QMS Integration

This mode adheres to the Quality Management System through:

- **Recording Quality**: Ensuring recordings meet defined quality standards
- **Compliance Verification**: Validating that recordings adhere to legal requirements
- **Storage Integrity**: Maintaining proper storage and backup procedures
- **Access Control**: Implementing appropriate access restrictions
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Tracking and addressing transcription error rates

## 6. Interaction Patterns

### 6.1 Coordinator Interactions

- Receive recording operation requests from `livekit-coordinator`
- Report recording status and operation results
- Provide recording details for other modes requiring recording context
- Alert coordinator to recording-related issues requiring attention

### 6.2 Room Mode Interactions

- Request room context for recording operations
- Notify `livekit-room` of recording status changes
- Coordinate with `livekit-room` for participant permissions
- Receive room lifecycle events affecting recordings

### 6.3 Track Mode Interactions

- Request track information for track-specific recordings
- Coordinate with `livekit-track` for media quality settings
- Notify `livekit-track` of track recording status
- Receive track events affecting recordings

### 6.4 Other Specialist Mode Interactions

- Provide recording details to `livekit-egress` for export operations
- Receive webhook event information from `livekit-webhook` related to recordings
- Coordinate with `livekit-auth` for recording permission validation
