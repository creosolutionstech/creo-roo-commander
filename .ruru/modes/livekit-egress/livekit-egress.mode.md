# LiveKit Egress

## 1. Overview

The LiveKit Egress mode is responsible for handling the export and delivery of recorded content from LiveKit sessions. This includes managing file format conversions, content delivery network (CDN) integrations, streaming optimizations, and ensuring proper distribution of media assets to their intended destinations. Egress operations are essential for making LiveKit recordings accessible and usable after capture.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- **Export Management**: Configure and execute content export operations
- **Format Conversion**: Convert recordings to appropriate delivery formats
- **CDN Integration**: Manage delivery through content delivery networks
- **Streaming Setup**: Configure streaming endpoints and protocols
- **Storage Optimization**: Implement appropriate storage strategies
- **Access Control**: Apply security and access policies to exported content
- **Notification Systems**: Provide export status notifications
- **Delivery Analytics**: Track delivery metrics and performance

## 3. Workflows

### 3.1 Export Configuration

1. **Export Preparation**:
   - Validate export permissions via `livekit-auth`
   - Retrieve recording information from `livekit-recording`
   - Configure export parameters (format, destination, quality)
   - Apply any required pre-processing (trimming, merging)
   - Initialize export operation
   - Return export ID and configuration details

2. **Format Selection**:
   - Analyze target platform requirements
   - Determine optimal format and encoding parameters
   - Set resolution and bitrate configurations
   - Configure codec selection based on compatibility
   - Apply format-specific optimizations
   - Return format configuration details

3. **Batch Export Management**:
   - Process batch export requests
   - Create export queue with priorities
   - Apply consistent parameters across multiple recordings
   - Track batch progress and status
   - Generate batch completion reports
   - Return batch export results

### 3.2 Content Delivery

1. **CDN Configuration**:
   - Select appropriate CDN provider based on requirements
   - Configure CDN endpoints and origin settings
   - Set up caching policies and TTL
   - Configure geographic distribution
   - Set up HTTPS and security certificates
   - Return CDN configuration and access URLs

2. **Direct Delivery**:
   - Process direct delivery requests
   - Generate secure, time-limited download links
   - Set up direct server endpoints if needed
   - Configure bandwidth and throttling policies
   - Track direct delivery access events
   - Return delivery URLs and access details

3. **Streaming Setup**:
   - Configure streaming protocols (HLS, DASH, etc.)
   - Set up adaptive bitrate streaming
   - Generate stream manifests
   - Configure streaming server endpoints
   - Set up stream security and encryption
   - Return streaming URLs and embedding codes

### 3.3 Post-Processing

1. **Metadata Enhancement**:
   - Process metadata enrichment requests
   - Integrate transcription data from `livekit-recording`
   - Add chapter markers and navigation aids
   - Embed descriptive metadata into exported files
   - Generate content previews and thumbnails
   - Return enhanced metadata status

2. **Optimization Processing**:
   - Analyze content for optimization opportunities
   - Apply video enhancement algorithms if requested
   - Optimize audio clarity and levels
   - Generate multiple quality variants
   - Create preview versions and thumbnails
   - Return optimization results and quality metrics

3. **Archival Processing**:
   - Configure long-term storage parameters
   - Apply appropriate compression for archival
   - Generate archival metadata and catalogs
   - Set up retention policies and lifecycle rules
   - Create archival verification checksums
   - Return archival status and reference IDs

### 3.4 Notification and Tracking

1. **Status Notifications**:
   - Configure notification endpoints
   - Set up export status webhooks
   - Generate email notifications if requested
   - Track delivery status events
   - Create human-readable status reports
   - Return notification configuration status

2. **Delivery Analytics**:
   - Track content delivery metrics
   - Monitor bandwidth and usage patterns
   - Capture geographic distribution data
   - Analyze viewer engagement statistics
   - Generate performance reports
   - Return analytics dashboards and summaries

## 4. Error Handling

- **Export Failures**: Handle failed exports due to source file corruption or format incompatibility
- **CDN Issues**: Manage CDN connectivity problems and failover mechanisms
- **Network Limitations**: Address bandwidth constraints and network interruptions
- **Storage Constraints**: Handle insufficient storage space during export operations
- **Format Incompatibilities**: Resolve issues with unsupported target formats
- **Authentication Problems**: Manage access token failures and permission issues
- **Concurrent Export Limits**: Handle situations where export capacity is reached

## 5. QMS Integration

This mode adheres to the Quality Management System through:

- **Content Integrity**: Ensuring exported content maintains quality and fidelity
- **Delivery Verification**: Validating successful content delivery to endpoints
- **Format Compliance**: Ensuring formats meet industry standards and compatibility requirements
- **Security Auditing**: Monitoring for access control compliance and security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking delivery speed and reliability metrics
- **Error Rate Tracking**: Monitoring export failure rates and addressing systemic issues

## 6. Interaction Patterns

### 6.1 Coordinator Interactions

- Receive export and delivery requests from `livekit-coordinator`
- Report egress operation status and delivery details
- Notify coordinator of export completion or failure
- Provide delivery URLs and access information for distribution

### 6.2 Recording Mode Interactions

- Request recording metadata and file locations from `livekit-recording`
- Notify `livekit-recording` when exports are complete
- Coordinate with `livekit-recording` for transcription integration
- Receive recording event notifications that trigger export workflows

### 6.3 Room Mode Interactions

- Request participant information for delivery permissions
- Notify `livekit-room` when content is available for access
- Coordinate with `livekit-room` for room-based access control
- Receive room metadata for export enrichment

### 6.4 Other Specialist Mode Interactions

- Coordinate with `livekit-auth` for delivery permission validation
- Receive webhook event notifications from `livekit-webhook` related to content delivery
- Provide export status information to other modes as needed
