# Roo Commander: Complete Architectural Analysis

## Executive Summary
Roo Commander represents a sophisticated **multi-agent orchestration framework** that transforms VS Code into an intelligent development environment. Built as a coordination layer, it manages 50+ specialized AI agents through hierarchical delegation, structured task management, and comprehensive knowledge systems.

## 🎯 Core Architecture Principles

**1. Hierarchical Multi-Agent Design**
- **Directors** (`roo-commander`, `prime-coordinator`) → **Managers** → **Leads** → **Specialists** → **Agent Services**
- Each layer focuses on appropriate abstraction levels: strategy → coordination → execution → specialized functions

**2. Conditional Intelligence**
- **Smart KB Consultation**: Knowledge Base access triggered only for complex/novel/high-risk scenarios
- **Adaptive Delegation**: Simple `new_task` vs. comprehensive MDTM workflows based on complexity assessment
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Stack Profile integration guides specialist selection

**3. Structured Knowledge Management**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Rules define procedures ("how"), KB articles contain detailed content ("what")
- **Template-Driven Standardization**: 40+ templates ensuring consistency across all document types
- **Session-Aware Context**: V7 session management with artifact preservation and traceability

## 🤖 Mode System Architecture

**Hierarchical Organization:**
```
Directors (2) → Managers (4) → Leads (8) → Specialists (35+) → Agents (10+)
    ↓              ↓             ↓            ↓              ↓
Strategic      Product/       Domain       Technology     Utility
Planning      Project Mgmt    Leads        Experts        Services
```

**Standardized Capability Framework:**
- **Permission Groups**: `read`, `edit`, `browser`, `command`, `mcp` - standardized capability sets
- **Mode Configuration**: JSON-based definitions in `.roomodes` with role definitions and constraints
- **Intelligent Routing**: Stack Profile (`.ruru/context/stack_profile.json`) guides mode selection based on project technology choices

## 📋 MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management)

**Revolutionary Task Tracking System:**
- **TOML+Markdown Format**: Machine-readable metadata + human-readable checklists
- **Structured Templates**: Feature, Bug, Chore, Documentation, Test, Spike variants
- **Lifecycle Management**: Status tracking (`🟡 To Do` → `🟢 Done` → `⚪ Blocked`)
- **Specialist Integration**: Automatic delegation with progress updates and completion reporting

**Template Structure Example:**
```toml
+++
id = "TASK-REACT-20250815-140500"
title = "Implement User Authentication"
status = "🟡 To Do"
type = "🌟 Feature"
assigned_to = "dev-react"
coordinator = "TASK-CMD-20250815-140400"
+++

## Description ✍️
- **What:** User login/logout functionality
- **Why:** Enable personalized user experiences
- **Scope:** Frontend authentication flow

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- [ ] Login form with validation
- [ ] JWT token handling
- [ ] Protected route implementation
- [ ] Logout functionality
```

## 📚 Knowledge Base & Rules System

**Multi-Layered Governance:**
1. **Workspace Rules** (`.roo/rules/`): Universal standards (TOML+MD format, tool syntax, session management)
2. **Mode-Specific Rules** (`.roo/rules-roo-commander/`): Specialized operational procedures
3. **Knowledge Base** (`.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/`): Detailed procedures for complex scenarios
4. **Conditional Consultation**: KB lookup triggered only when rules point to specific procedures

**Sophisticated Information Architecture:**
- **Abstraction Principle**: Procedural logic separated from detailed content
- **Conditional Access**: Smart assessment prevents unnecessary KB lookups for routine tasks
- **Systematic Scanning**: When KB consultation needed, follows structured discovery procedures

---

## 🗂️ Template & Standardization System

**Comprehensive Template Library:**
- **40+ Standardized Templates** covering every document type
- **TOML+Markdown Format**: Consistent metadata structure across all artifacts
- **Hierarchical Organization**:
  - General templates (`.ruru/templates/toml-md/`)
  - Mode-specific templates (`.ruru/templates/modes/`)  
  - Workflow templates (`.ruru/templates/workflows/`)
  - Session artifact templates (31-42 series for session context)

**Key Benefits:**
- **Machine Readability**: TOML frontmatter enables automation, filtering, AI context understanding
- **Human Readability**: Markdown bodies provide familiar editing experience
- **Lifecycle Management**: Built-in status, versioning, and relationship tracking
- **Consistency**: Standardized schemas prevent format variations

## 📊 Session Management V7

**Advanced Interaction Tracking:**
- **Optional Session Logs**: User-controlled creation with goal-based organization
- **Structured Artifacts**: 12 standard subdirectories (notes, learnings, environment, research, etc.)
- **TOML+Markdown Integration**: Session logs use standard format with rich metadata
- **Traceability**: Links between sessions, MDTM tasks, and generated artifacts

**Session Directory Structure:**
```
.ruru/sessions/SESSION-UserGoal-2508161200/
├── session_log.md (TOML+Markdown format)
└── artifacts/
    ├── notes/         (decisions, plans)
    ├── learnings/     (problems solved, recommendations)
    ├── environment/   (system details, component info)
    ├── research/      (external findings)
    ├── blockers/      (impediments)
    ├── context/       (reference materials)
    └── deferred/      (future work items)
```

## 🔮 Architectural Innovations

**1. Conditional Knowledge Access**
Rather than loading all procedures into every mode, Roo Commander uses smart assessment to trigger detailed KB consultation only when needed, optimizing context efficiency.

**2. Multi-Format Standardization**
TOML+Markdown combination provides the best of both worlds: machine-readable structure with human-friendly editing experience.

**3. Session-Aware Context Management**
Session artifacts create persistent context that survives individual interactions, enabling true continuity across extended development workflows.

**4. Hierarchical Capability Distribution**
Permission groups and mode hierarchies ensure appropriate task delegation while maintaining security and specialized expertise.
